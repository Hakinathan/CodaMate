# CodaMate

It's my landing page for my first service. I give some private lessons for people who want to learn how to code.

I developed this website with ReactJS with Vite and I used the following libraries:

- [React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Hamburger React](https://hamburger-react.netlify.app/)
